# Artist Statement: Coloring with Gray

Coloring with Gray is a digital portal—a living vortex—conceived for Palais de Tokyo as a meditation on absence, memory, and the thresholds of emergence. The work is intentionally restrained: it resists spectacle, inviting slow, deliberate engagement. Only through gentle, distributed coloring does the portal reveal its inner dimension, referencing the labor of memory and the poetics of what remains unseen.

The visual language is strictly grayscale, erasing all black and brown in favor of deep matte grays and subtle gradients. The portal’s rotation is slow, analog, and meditative, echoing the passage of time and the instability of recollection. The blurred hologram, glimpsed through the vortex, is a preview of a reflection site—a world within the world, accessible only through earned participation.

Transitions are soft, effects are restrained, and every detail is calibrated to maintain conceptual and aesthetic clarity. This is a work about earning emergence, about the quiet labor of attention, and about the beauty of what is almost, but not quite, revealed.
