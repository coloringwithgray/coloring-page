# Coloring with Gray

A meditative, interactive portal exploring absence, memory, and emergence. Conceived for digital submission to Palais de Tokyo, this project embodies conceptual restraint, poetic transitions, and a living grayscale vortex aesthetic.

## Concept

**Coloring with Gray** invites visitors to engage with a digital canvas and experience the emergence of a dimensional portal. The work is governed by principles of earned emergence, absence, and memory—only revealing its inner reflection after a threshold of interaction is met. The visual language is strictly grayscale, with slow, analog transitions and a holographic preview that evokes the sense of peering into another dimension.

## Features
- Fully grayscale palette—no black or brown tints, only deep matte grays and gradients.
- Living vortex portal with slow, meditative rotation and analog wobble.
- Portal preview emerges only after 1.37% of the canvas is colored across at least 3 grid zones.
- Dimensional hologram (blurred, grayscale iframe) with subtle parallax.
- Conceptual restraint in all transitions and effects.
- Responsive, accessible design.

## Usage
- Click the crayon to activate drawing.
- Color the canvas—once the threshold is met, the portal will appear.
- Hover or focus on the portal to preview the reflection site.

## Technical
- All assets are in the `assets/` directory for clarity and maintainability.
- No backend required; deploys as a static site on Vercel.
- For exhibition or curation, see `ARTIST_STATEMENT.md` for conceptual framing.

## Deployment
